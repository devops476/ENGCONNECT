 ⨯ suspendIfSsr() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/admin/classes". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/missing-suspense-with-csr-bailout

This code path attempted to display a loading indicator, but didn't find a Suspense boundary above it. Please read the error message below carefully.

The fix depends on which of the 4 scenarios caused it:

1. [Next.js] You are missing a loading.tsx file in your app directory. Fix it by adding a loading.tsx file in your app directory.

2. [React] You are missing a <Suspense> boundary in your component. Fix it by wrapping your component (or the entire app) in a <Suspense> component.

3. [Next.js] The component is rendered in the root (outermost) layout.tsx or template.tsx file. Next.js does not wrap those files in a Suspense boundary, even if there is a loading.tsx file in the same folder. To fix it, wrap your layout inside a route group like this:

  - app
  - - layout.tsx  // contains <html> and <body>, alongside providers and other components that don't need this code path
  - - loading.tsx  // required for suspense
  - - (main)
  - - - layout.tsx  // contains the main layout of your app, like a sidebar or a header, and can use this code path
  - - - route.tsx  // your actual main page
  - - - the rest of your app

  For more information on this approach, see Next's documentation on route groups: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups

4. You caught this error with try-catch or a custom error boundary. Fix this by rethrowing the error or not catching it in the first place.
